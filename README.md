# Lab Structure
# Each lab folder follows a similar structure:

## README.md: This file (you're reading it now!) provides an overview of the lab's objective, exercises, and expected outcomes.
Source Code: The implementation of the lab exercises is located here. File names should be descriptive and reflect the task they solve (e.g., Lab1_Array_Basics.java).
Lab Content
The labs cover a wide range of algorithms and data structures, including:

# Lab 1: Arrays

Basic array operations (declaration, initialization, traversal)
Searching and sorting techniques in arrays
Lab 2 & 3: Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)

# Implementing a linked list class
Insertion, deletion, and traversal operations
LeetCode practice problems on linked lists
Lab 4: Stacks

# Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists
Real-world applications of stacks (e.g., parenthesis balancing)
LeetCode practice problems on stacks
Lab 5 & 6: Sorting Algorithms

# Implementing Bubble Sort and its optimized version
Modifications for sorting strings by length
LeetCode practice problems on sorting
Lab 7 & 8: Binary Trees

# Binary tree representation and node structure
Insertion and traversal techniques (Level-order, Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)
Understanding tree properties
Lab 9 & 10: Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

# BST implementation with insertion maintaining BST properties
Searching, counting nodes, and performing traversals in BSTs
LeetCode practice problems on BSTs

## Lab 11: Graphs
Graph representation using adjacency matrices
Shortest path algorithms and finding all paths
Identifying connected components in an undirected graph
Contribution
